## Overview 📊

The Chain Breaker Data Catalog is a comprehensive resource that organizes, explores, and presents data collected from online sexual advertisements. This repository provides an **obfuscated** version of the data catalog, enabling researchers, analysts, and policymakers to conduct independent research on online sex commerce—a domain that serves as a proxy for understanding and combating human trafficking.

## Purpose 🎯

The primary goal of this repository is to empower the community to uncover insights into online sex commerce by providing structured and standardized data. By analyzing this data, you can detect patterns, trends, and anomalies that may indicate human trafficking activities, ultimately supporting efforts to disrupt these illicit networks.

## Data Description 📑

The data catalog is organized into several key tables:

### 1. Ads Table 📢
- **Description:** Contains data on online sexual advertisements.
- **Key Fields:** Publication date, website details, unique advertisement identifiers, and demographic information (e.g., age, ethnicity, gender).
- **Usage:** Enables the detection of potential human trafficking cases and supports compliance initiatives such as KYC policies.

### 2. Rates Table 💲
- **Description:** Provides information on pricing trends for sexual advertisements.
- **Key Fields:** Time unit, time value, rate type, amount, and currency details.
- **Usage:** Useful for analyzing price dynamics and understanding the influence of various factors on pricing in this domain.

### 3. Reviews Table ⭐
- **Description:** Contains customer reviews of sexual services.
- **Key Fields:** Reviewer feedback, ratings (service and appearance), and meeting details (date, length, price).
- **Usage:** Offers insights into customer satisfaction and service quality, which can be critical in assessing the legitimacy of service providers.

### 4. Standard Location Table 🌍
- **Description:** Contains geographical information for various locations.
- **Key Fields:** Country, state, city, latitude, longitude, and ISO codes.
- **Usage:** Facilitates spatial analysis and mapping, enabling the categorization and tracking of geographical data across different regions.

All sensitive information has been obfuscated to protect privacy while still maintaining the integrity and usefulness of the data for research purposes.
